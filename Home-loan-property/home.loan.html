                                your home loan tenure, which
                                generally ranges from 15 - 30 years. The tenure you choose directly impacts the EMI you
                                pay
                                every month.

                                comparison to the personal loans. This is because home loans are generally secured loans
                                whereas personal
                                loans are unsecured loans.

                                amount on the disbursed home loan until the construction of the property is completed.
                                This
                                means if a borrower opts for pre-EMI, he/she will not have to pay the principal amount
                                until
                                the property is ready for possession. Thus, once the property is ready, the pre-EMI
                                payments
                                will end and the EMI payments will start.

                                For example: A person takes a home loan with a tenure of 30 years. The construction of
                                the
                                property completes in 5 years. If this person opts for pre-EMI, he will have to pay the
                                interest every month for 5 years. After 5 years, this person will start paying regular
                                EMIs
                                (interest + principal) for 30 years.

                                <code> Who should opt for pre-EMI?</code>
                                This option works best for those who are living in a rental home and, therefore, cannot
                                afford to pay the full EMI plus the rent every month. With pre-EMI option, such
                                borrowers
                                will be required to pay "interest only" until the property is ready for possession.

                                        <strong>How to Calculate Home Loan EMI Using the Formula?</strong>
                                        <p>The classic way of calculating the EMI is by using the formula stated below:
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            EMI = [P x R x (1+R)^T]/[(1+R)^ (T-1)].
                                        </p>

                                            Let's take an example to understand this clearly. For instance, you have
                                            taken a
                                            Home Loan of Rs 2 Lakh which is to be paid in 2 years at an interest rate of
                                            20%
                                            per
                                            annum.
                                            <br>
                                            <br>
                                            First, convert the yearly interest rate into months. We can obtain the
                                            monthly
                                            interest rate by dividing the yearly interest rate by no. of months in a
                                            year
                                            i.e.
                                            12. So, monthly interest will be 20/12 = 1.66%.

                                                requires minimal calculation and can determine the EMI within seconds.

                                                Apply for a Balance Transfer Loan: With a Balance Transfer home loan,

                                                can
                                                transfer your existing home loan to another lender that is offering

                                                interest rates.

                                                Make loan prepayments: In the initial years of home loan, you pay more
                                                towards
                                                the interest and less towards the principal amount. Therefore, if you

                                                prepayments regularly, you can reduce your interest burden.

                                                Choose the right EMI calculation method: There are two ways banks can
                                                calculate
                                                your EMI: Flat Rate method and Reducing Balance method. Under the Flat
                                                Rate
                                                method, the interest is calculated on the original loan amount for the
                                                entire
                                                tenure; thus your interest outgo remains equal throughout the tenure and
                                                doesn't
                                                decrease as the principal amount reduces. However, in the latter method,
                                                the
                                                interest is calculated and revised every month based on your outstanding
                                                principal amount.

                                            <p>Age: It's one of the most important factors to determine the home loan
                                                tenure.
                                                For instance, getting a home loan with 30-year tenure is easier for a
                                                young
                                                individual compared to an aged individual.</p>
                                            <p>Income: Whether you are a salaried or self-employed individual, you must
                                                meet
                                                the
                                                minimum income requirement set by the banks. The income requirement may
                                                vary
                                                from bank to bank</p>
                                            <p>CIBIL Score or Credit Score: This score is used by lenders to determine
                                                your
                                                creditworthiness. Higher the score, the better the chances of loan
                                                approval.
                                                A
                                                CIBIL score of above 550 and near 900 is generally considered good.
                                                However,
                                                if
                                                your CIBIL score is not good, you can still apply for a home loan.</p>
                                            <p>Employment/ Business type: Lenders also consider your job type or
                                                business
                                                type
                                                to determine your eligibility. Applicants with a stable job or business
                                                income
                                                have a higher chance of getting the loan approved.</p>
